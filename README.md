# ALX Higher Level Programming
  - This repository is a collection of directories containing a combination of\
   `bash` scripts `C` programs and `Python` scripts as part of my\
   Fullstack Software Engineering learning journey with ALX
  - The file contained in these directories demonstrate my knowledge and\
   understanding of the fundamental principles of computer programming
  - All scripts and progrmas were created, compiled and tested on an\
   Ubuntu 20.04 environment

# Usage
  - All `C` programs were compiled using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file(s)>`
  - Python programs can be run directly on Unix systems `./<filename>` or\
    `python3 <filename>`
