i# ALX Higher Level Programming
  - This repository is a collection of directories containing a combination of\
   `bash` scripts `C` programs and `Python` scripts as part of my\
   Fullstack Software Engineering learning journey with ALX
  - The file contained in these directories demonstrate my knowledge and\
   understanding of the fundamental principles of computer programming
  - All scripts and progrmas were created, compiled and tested on an\
   Ubuntu 20.04 environment
